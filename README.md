# Personalized XAI Algorithm â€“ Experiments Overview

This repository contains two experiments focused on generating data and applying explainability techniques using different neural network architectures and datasets.

---

## ðŸ§ª Experiment 1: EMNIST Alphabet with CNN

This experiment involves generating classification data using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the EMNIST alphabet dataset.

### ðŸ“¥ Dataset
To run this experiment, download the following files from the [EMNIST Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist):

- `emnist-letters-train.csv`
- `emnist-letters-test.csv`

Place both files inside the `experiment 1/` directory.

### ðŸ“‚ Important File
- `eminst.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook for generating and analyzing the EMNIST data.

## ðŸ§  Experiment 2: Raven-10k with DCNet

This experiment involves generating reasoning data using the DCNet model for abstract visual pattern understanding.  
The model implementation is adapted from the official DCNet repository:  
ðŸ”— https://github.com/visiontao/dcnet/tree/main

### ðŸ“¥ Dataset
Download the **RAVEN-10k dataset** from the following page:  
ðŸ”— https://wellyzhang.github.io/project/raven.html#dataset  
Then click on the **Google Drive link**, and place the dataset in the appropriate directory.

### ðŸ“‚ Important Files
- `generate_data.py` â€“ Generates image folders of Raven-style matrix puzzles and runs various explanation types.
- `main.py` â€“ Demonstrates an example explanation flow on a Raven puzzle instance.
